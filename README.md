# Aircraft-Monitoring

This project simulates a system for tracking and logging various changes in airplane.

Four sensors are simulates: Wing Viberation (Hertz (Hz)), Engine Temperature (Celsius Degrees), Pressure (Pounds per square inch (PSI)), and Angular (Radians).

Three types of signals are modeled: constant, saw tooth, and sine wave. These signals will be hard coded to be predictable; a specific signal will always generate the same voltage for a given point in time. The monitoring system tracks changes to phenomena by attaching a sensor to each phenomenonâ€™s signal. A sensor applies a meaning to the voltage generated by the signal. For example, a sensor attached to the signal generated by vibrations in the wings would interpret a voltage level of 42 to mean the wings are vibrating at 42 Hertz (cycles per second). To conclude, a signal represents a changing voltage over time (42 volts at time = 3 seconds) while a sensor interprets that voltage to have a specific meaning by applying a name (wing vibration) and unit of measurement (Hertz) to the voltage.

At any point in time the monitoring system can be instructed to log the current voltage being observed by each sensor.
