# Aircraft-Monitoring

This project simulates a system for tracking and logging various changes in airplane.

Three types of signals are modeled: constant, saw tooth, and sine wave. These signals will be hard coded to be predictable; a specific signal will always generate the same voltage for a given point in time.
