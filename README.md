# Aircraft-Monitoring

This project simulates a system for tracking and logging various changes in airplane.

Four sensors are simulates: Wing Viberation (Hertz (Hz)), Engine Temperature (Celsius Degrees), Pressure (Pounds per square inch (PSI)), and Angular (Radians).

Three types of signals are modeled: constant, saw tooth, and sine wave. These signals will be hard coded to be predictable; a specific signal will always generate the same voltage for a given point in time. 

At any point in time the monitoring system can be instructed to log the current voltage being observed by each sensor.
